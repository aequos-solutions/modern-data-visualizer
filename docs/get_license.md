## Licence types

You need a valid license to use the _"Modern Data Visualizer"_ Web Parts. We offer two kinds of license: [www.aequos.ca](https://www.aequos.ca/#comp-kmng61o4){:target="_blank"}

Except their duration, our license offer the same specifications: 

- All Web Parts included (Data Visualizer, Data Filters, Data Verticals, Search Box and Group Metadata Editor).
- Unlimited users. The size of your organisation doesn't matter.
- Free upgrades from our GitHub repository. However, no automatic upgrade process, you must manually update the package like a regular SharePoint Framework package.
- One license per Microsoft 365 tenant ID. If you have two tenants (ex: DEV/PRODUCTION), you must purchase two licenses.
- A license is not transferable between tenants.

## Get a subscription license

You can get a valid license directly from our [website](https://www.aequos.ca) or, if you prefer to receive a formal quote and pay with the registration of a PO number, contact us at [mdv@sword-group.com](mailto:mdv@sword-group.com). It will be our pleasure to answer you. 

In both scenarios, we will need the **Microsoft 365 Tenant ID** where you plan to use the solution. If you don't know how to get this information, you can use this online [tool](https://www.whatismytenantid.com/).
