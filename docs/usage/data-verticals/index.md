### Configure verticals

The options for a vertical are as follow:

| **Setting** | **Description** |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Tab name** | The vertical name (i.e. tab) 
| **Tab value** | The vertical value that will be sent to connected 'Data Visualizer' Web Parts. You can use this value using the `{verticals.value}` token. See [tokens](../data-visualizer/tokens.md) for more info.
| **Fluent UIFabric icon name** | The optional Fluent UI icon to display for the tab. Refer to [Office UI Fabric documentation](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/styles/web/icons) to see all available icons.
| **Is hyperlink** | If checked, the tab will behave as an hyperlink meaning it won't trigger any selected event.
| **Link URL** | If the tab is an hyperlink, the link URL to use. Tokens `{<TokenName>}` are supported here. See [tokens](../data-visualizer/tokens.md) for more info.
| **Open behavior** | If the tab is an hyperlink, the opening behavior (new tab or current tab).
| **Show link icon** |  If the tab is an hyperlink, display or hide an icon next to the tab name indicating the tab is a link (same page or external).

> The 'Data Verticals' Web Part does not need to be connected to any Web Part. However, it is meant to be used by a 'Data Visualizer' Web Part to get it work. More info about configuration [here](../data-visualizer/connections/index.md).

> We recommend to configure the 'Data Visualizer' Web Parts that will use verticals **before connecting them to the verticals Web Part**.
